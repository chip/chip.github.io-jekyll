I'm currently preparing a screencast called [Learning the UNIX command line on
OS X](http://learning-the-unix-command-line-on-os-x.chipcastle.com), which will
be targeted towards the beginner level for software developers and systems
administrators.

Even if you're beyond the beginner level or not interested in the screencast,
I'll also be providing regular tips on **UNIX** and **Linux** via our [Email
newsletter](http://learning-the-unix-command-line-on-os-x.chipcastle.com), so
please sign up if you're interested.

As an added bonus, I'll also be providing a **FREE PDF of software development
tips** for anyone who subscribes to the list.  I hope you'll find them to be
helpful.

Thanks,

Chip Castle
