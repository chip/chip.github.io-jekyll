Are you wondering if you have a UNIX alias already set for a specific command?

You can find it easily by issuing this on the command line:

    alias

This command will list all aliases currently set for you shell account.

To get the most out of this command based on your current command history,
please check out my other post [Top 10 shell commands you currently
use](/2013/05/10/top-10-shell-commands-you-currently-use/).

Enjoy,
