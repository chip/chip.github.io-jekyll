# Rake task list in Rails

Sometimes in **Rails** it's helpful to see a list of **Rake** tasks that are
available to you.  Maybe you know there's a task that does something specific, but you can't quite remember what it was called.  

The solution?  Just list the tasks, like so:

    rake -T

On a few of my projects, this returns quite a massive list of rake tasks, which
can take a while to sift through.  To speed this up, you can always provide a
prefix to help **Rake** filter the results.  For example, let's say I want to
list all of the **db** related tasks, I can just do this:

    rake -T db

On my system running **Rails 3.2.13**, this is the result:

    * rake -T db
    rake db:create          # Create the database from…
    rake db:drop            # Drops the database using…
    rake db:fixtures:load   # Load fixtures into the current…
    rake db:migrate         # Migrate the database…
    rake db:migrate:status  # Display status of migrations...
    rake db:rollback        # Rolls the schema back to the…
    rake db:schema:dump     # Create a db/schema.rb file that…
    rake db:schema:load     # Load a schema.rb file into…
    rake db:seed            # Load the seed data from db/seeds.rb
    rake db:setup           # Create the database, load…
    rake db:structure:dump  # Dump the database structure to…
    rake db:version         # Retrieves the current schema… 
    
This has been a nice little time-saver for me, so I hope you get similar mileage.
