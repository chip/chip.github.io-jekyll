						<li class="fragment roll-in">Work began in 1969 at Bell Labs</li>
						<li class="fragment roll-in">Solaris, Linux, Mac OS X, and <strong>many</strong> others</li>
						<li class="fragment roll-in">Powerful tool, but also overwhelming</li>

						<li class="fragment roll-in">Principles have stood the test of time</li>

					<aside class="notes">
						In 1969, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and other researchers at Bell Labs
						starting working on an operating system that would eventually be known as UNIX.
						Since that time many different variants of the operating system have cropped up,
						such as Solaris, Linux, Mac OS X and many, many others.

						Several decades since its inception, UNIX is still at the heart of the Internet
						and computing in general. In my view, a tool this powerful that has withstood
						such a rapid change in a fast-paced industry, with tools and techniques that are
						still essential to our everyday work, is something that needs to be learned and
						used regularly.

					<h2>My own 2 cents</h2>

						<li class="fragment roll-in">Powerful Tool</li>
						<li class="fragment roll-in">Ubiquitous</li>

					<aside class="notes">
					  My own 2 cents about UNIX and why you should learn it.

						UNIX is enormous topic and the tools available are virtually limitless, but
						after working with it for over 20 years, I have found that a little knowledge
						can take you a long way. 

						I have worked with a number of newcomers to systems administration, as well as
						junior and even some senior software developers who simply did not have the
						UNIX knowledge necessary to solve certain problems.  

						Even non-developers like Front-end engineers, User Interface designers and
						general Mac users could greatly benefit if they had at least a basic
						understanding of how to get the most out of their system.

						With an understanding of the core principles and commands, anyone that has the
						interest can learn what it takes to become a UNIX wizard, or at a minimum have
						a level of expertise and comfort with the operating system that makes their job
						easier. My hope is that this course will help you do just that.
