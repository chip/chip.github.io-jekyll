# Why should I learn the UNIX command line?

Before embarking on this course, you might be asking yourself, "Why
should I learn the UNIX command line?".  

To help you make that decision, I've put together a list of reasons why
you might want to pursue learning more about UNIX:

* You want to be a software developer or systems administrator

* You're pursuing a degree that requires UNIX knowledge

* You want to contribute to Open Source Software

* You want to understand your system better so you can fix it yourself 

If any of those reasons resonate with you, then hopefully you'll find
this course to be a valuable first step in becoming more proficient with
the UNIX operating system and it's various tools and concepts.


# Brief history

In 1969, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and other researchers at Bell Labs
starting working on an operating system that would eventually be known as UNIX.
Since that time many different variants of the operating system have cropped up,
such as Solaris, Linux, Mac OS X and many, many others.

Several decades since its inception, UNIX is still at the heart of the Internet
and computing in general. In my view, a tool this powerful that has withstood
such a rapid change in a fast-paced industry, with tools and techniques that are
still essential to our everyday work, is something that needs to be learned and
used regularly.

* Work began in 1969 at Bell Labs

* Numerous variations have been spawn since then: BSD, Sun OS, Aix, HP/UX,
  SCO, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, Linux, Mac OS X, etc.

* UNIX is a vast and powerful tool, but also overwhelming to some

* Not enough people in technology are taught UNIX

* UNIX principles have stood the test of time even in a fast-based industry


# UNIX philosophy

Throughout the history of UNIX there have been countless contributors to
its source code, associated tools and its overall philosophy.  And
although I cannot cover them all here, I'd like to discuss a few of my
favorites:

  * Mike Gancarz, "The UNIX Philosophy"

    http://www.amazon.com/The-UNIX-Philosophy-Mike-Gancarz/dp/1555581234
     
    - "Small is beautiful"

    - "Make each program do one thing well"

  * Richard P. Gabriel's design philosophy, "worse is better".

    http://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html

    - The idea is that quality does not necessarily increase with functionality.

  * Eric S. Raymond's, "The Art of Unix Programming"

    http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/

    - K.I.S.S. - Keep It Simple, Stupid!

You can use these references as a starting point to learn more about
UNIX history and how these ideas helped form the overall philosophy,
which in my view, drove much of its success.  

Then take what you've learned from these and other resources to help
form your own philosophy and work style, as well as helping you improve
your overall usage of the UNIX operating system itself.


# My own 2 cents

UNIX is enormous topic and the tools available are virtually limitless, but
after working with it for over 20 years, I have found that a little knowledge
can take you a long way. 

I have worked with a number of newcomers to systems administration, as well as
junior and even some senior software developers who simply did not have the
UNIX knowledge necessary to solve certain problems.  

Even non-developers like Front-end engineers, User Interface designers and
general Mac users could greatly benefit if they had at least a basic
understanding of how to get the most out of their system.

With an understanding of the core principles and commands, anyone that has the
interest can learn what it takes to become a UNIX wizard, or at a minimum have
a level of expertise and comfort with the operating system that makes their job
easier. My hope is that this course will help you do just that.
