# Course conclusion

To wrap up this course, let's recap some of the concepts and commands
that were covered in each section, as well as recommended resources to
further your knowledge of the UNIX command line.


## Resources

During this tutorial, we covered a brief overview of UNIX history and
philosophy.  Some important resources were referenced during that
discussion and are highly recommended reading:

  * [The UNIX Philosophy](http://www.amazon.com/The-UNIX-Philosophy-Mike-Gancarz/dp/1555581234)
    by Mike Gancarz
     
  * [Worse is better](http://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html)
    by Richard P. Gabriel

  * [The Art of Unix Programming](http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/)
    by Eric S. Raymond 


## Further learning

I've personally worked with UNIX and Linux-based systems for more than 20 years
and have always found it to be an enormously powerful tool.  As a strong
advocate for the UNIX operating system and its overriding philosophy,
I've embarked upon creating a variety of resources that allow others to
discover the power and usefulness of its commands and core concepts.  

In addition to this screencast tutorial, I have also started a free
online newsletter:

Please visit this site for more UNIX command line tips and subscribe to
the free email newsletter to keep up to date with further suggestions
for how you can improve your skill level with the operating system.
